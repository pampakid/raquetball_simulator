# Raquetball Game Simulator

This program is inspired in the following excerpt:
<br>

“In raquetball, a player continues to serve as long as she is winning; a point is scored only when a player is serving and wins the volley. The first player to win 21 points wins the game. Assume that you serve first and have probability .6 of winning a volley when you serve and probability .5 when your opponent serves. Estimate, by simulation, the probability that you will win a game.” (From Grinstead, C., & Snell, J. (2006). <a href = 'https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf'>Grinstead and Snell's introduction to probability.</a> Hanover, N.H.: The Chance Project. pg. 13.)
<br>

However, there are a couple of differences. These are that the users is the one who assigns the probabilities of winning points (both when serving and when the opponent is serving). Also, the program randomly decides which player starts serving.
